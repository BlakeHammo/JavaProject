alot of thinking about states and transitions from a parsed regular expression
I'll need a start state, and then a state for each character, plus an extra for kleene star, and a final accepting state

eg "ab"
From start, epsilon transition to first state
from first state transition on 'a' to second state
from second state transition on 'b' to third state
from third state transition on epsilon to accepting state

eg ab*c
From start, epsilon transition to first state
from first state transition on 'a' to second state
from second state transition on 'b' to third state
from third state transition on epsilon back to second state
from second state transition on 'c' to fourth state
from fourth state transition on epsilon to accepting state

eg ab+
from start, epsilon transition to first state
from first, transition on 'a' to second state
from second, transition on 'b' to third state
from third, transition on 'b' to third state
from third, transition on epsilon to accepting state



        //iterate through the regex input, creating states and simple transition for each
        //only for characters, no operators so far
        //operators are * + | ( )

        //open bracket, save current state
        //close bracket, previous state equal to open bracket state
        //change kleene star and plus functions if bracket state not equal to start state
